# Audrey's Portfolio
My name is Audrey, and this is my portfolio! I'm a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/).  
I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering.

### CPSC 120
* Lab 3
    Lab 3, part 1, was the first of my three favorite labs.  The file I edited, pizza.cc,
    gave me the opportunity to create a proper function for the main, which was instrumental
    in giving me a good foundation for how functions operate.  I really like this lab because
    of the moment that occured during it when the use of the function for the program, and for
    functions in general, clicked and made sense to me.
* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 2, is another of my favorite labs.  I liked it because it required many past concepts as well as new ones.
    I enjoyed using code to validate argument counts.  In addition to the practice this lab provided for writing
    command-line arguments, Lab 6 part 2 used function descriptions with more complex Boolean logic, which was very
    important for me to become comfortable with.  Finally, to write a correct game of Blackjack into a program gave me a
    very accomplished feeling.
* Lab 8
    Lab 8, part 2, is the final lab that I especially enjoyed.  This lab provided an opportunity to learn more technicalities
    of for-loops when they are used in a program that has command-line arguments.  For example, it was necessary to write a
    for-loop that skipped the command name in its loop path.  I enjoyed this lab because of the above learning objectives that
    it had, as I knew this practice certainly increased my C++ proficiency.
