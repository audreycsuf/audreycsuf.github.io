### CPSC 120

  Lab 3, part-1, is the first out of my three favorite labs. The file for this lab that I edited, pizza.cc, gave me the 
  opportunity to create a proper function for the main, which was instrumental in giving me a good foundation for how          functions operate. I really liked this lab because of the moment when the use of the function for the program, and the   
  operation of functions in general, clicked and made sense to me.

*
  Lab 6, part-2, is another of my favorite labs. I liked it because it required the use of many previous concepts as well as 
  new ones. I enjoyed using code to validate argument counts. In addition to the practice that this lab provided for writing 
  command-line arguments, Lab 6, part-2, used function descriptions with more complex Boolean logic, which was very 
  important for me to become comfortable with. Finally, to write a correct game of Blackjack into a program gave me a very 
  accomplished feeling.

  Lab 8, part-2, is the final lab that I especially enjoyed. This lab provided an opportunity to learn how to address some 
  technicalities of for-loops for when they are used in a program that has command-line arguments. For example, it was 
  necessary to write a for-loop that skipped the command name in its loop path. I enjoyed this lab because of the above 
  learning objectives that it had, as I knew that this practice certainly increased my C++ proficiency.
